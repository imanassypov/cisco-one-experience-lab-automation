# OTel Collector — Campus BGP EVPN Telemetry Pipeline

This folder holds the source of truth for the OpenTelemetry Collector that runs on the
lab Splunk host. The collector ingests Cisco IOS-XE Model-Driven Telemetry (MDT) over
gRPC dial-out from the Site 105 EVPN fabric and ships it, together with host metrics,
to the co-located Splunk HEC.

> **Deployment is automated.** Nothing here needs to be copied by hand — stages 03 and 04
> of [`../ansible/playbooks`](../ansible/playbooks/) build the binary and lay down the
> config. This README explains what those stages do and how to troubleshoot them.

> **Context for network engineers:** if you are new to OpenTelemetry or MDT, read the
> parent [`README.md`](../README.md) sections
> [Telemetry and Data Model](../README.md#4-telemetry-and-data-model)
> before tuning this collector.

## Numeric YANG List Keys — RESOLVED (custom build deployed 2026-06-23)

> **✅ Numeric list keys are now emitted as dimensions.** The earlier limitation
> (numeric YANG list keys silently dropped) is fixed by the patched
> `yanggrpcreceiver` build **`26_05_27`**
> ([`receiver_yang_26_05_27.tar.gz`](receiver_yang_26_05_27.tar.gz)), compiled
> into the custom collector `otelcol-yangfix` now running on the host. Full
> analysis and the resolution mechanism are in
> [`yanggrpcreceiver-numeric-key-issue.md`](yanggrpcreceiver-numeric-key-issue.md).

### The original problem

The `nve-oper-data/nve-oper/nve-peer-oper/peer-vni-group` list is keyed by
`vni` + `evni` (the VNI numbers from `show nve peers`). On Leaf-01 the CLI shows
**10** VNI×peer rows, but with the **stock v0.154.x** receiver these collapsed:
it did not emit `vni`/`evni`, leaving only `peer-addr` + the `rmac`/`_info`
string leaf. Loading the Cisco YANG models via the `yang:` block did **not** fix
it — the conversion path never consulted the parsed schema. Root cause was a
receiver code limitation (numeric leaves were only dimensioned when the protobuf
value was a `StringValue`; keys were also skipped from metric emission).

### How it was fixed

The patched receiver replaces the heuristic with a two-pass converter
(`extractKeysOnly` + `emitMetricsOnly`). `extractKeysOnly` stringifies **every**
leaf under the GPB `keys` branch via `formatValueToString` (handling
`Uint32`/`Uint64`/`Sint32`/`Sint64`), so numeric keys now survive as dimensions.

**Verified live (2026-06-23):** `peer-vni-group` now emits `vni` + `evni` +
`unit-number`; `nve-vni-oper` emits `vni-id`; `nve-vni-oper-counters` emits
`vni-id` (per-VNI throughput now possible). Real values confirmed — Leaf-02
`vni-id` 50101/50201/50221/50901/50902/50903; Leaf-01 `peer-vni-group` `vni`/`evni`
per peer.

### Dimension-model change you must know about

The fix also normalised the dimension model, which changed the attribute contract:

| Element | Stock v0.154.0 | Patched `26_05_27` |
|---|---|---|
| **Numeric list keys** | dropped | promoted to dims: `vni`, `vni-id`, `evni`, `unit-number`, `evpn-inst-id`, `vlan-id`, `evpn-stats-id` |
| **String list keys** (e.g. `peer-addr`) | dim | unchanged — still a dim |
| **String content leaves** (e.g. `vni-type`, `nve-vni-vrf`, `last-update`, `ni-name`) | dim named after the leaf | separate `cisco.<leaf>_info` metric; string carried in a generic **`value`** attribute |

Any query that grouped a numeric metric `BY "<string-content-leaf>"` now returns
**empty** and must be rewritten to group `BY "<numeric-key>"` (e.g. `"vni-id"`)
and pull string attributes from their `cisco.<leaf>_info` metric via the generic
`value` attribute. The Splunk app `campus_evpn_assurance` (v1.5.0 / build 85)
was fully migrated to this model.

### Per-VNI peer mapping — now telemetry-native

The NVE peer Sankey can now be discriminated by the **VNI number** directly:
`peer-vni-group` emits `vni` + `evni` as dimensions, so no `RMAC → VNI` lookup
enrichment is required anymore. (The `rmac` string is still emitted via
`cisco.rmac_info` if you want it.)

## Custom collector build & rollback

The fix ships as a **custom collector binary** (`otelcol-yangfix`) built from the
patched receiver source. The stock Splunk-distro rpm binary at `/usr/bin/otelcol`
is **left untouched**, so rollback is a one-liner.

### How it was built (on the host)

The tarball [`receiver_yang_26_05_27.tar.gz`](receiver_yang_26_05_27.tar.gz) is
bundled in this repo as receiver **source only** (no binary). The supported path is
to build `otelcol-yangfix` from that source with Go 1.25+ and the
OpenTelemetry Collector Builder. The exact staged install procedure is documented
in [`../SETUP_GUIDE.md`](../SETUP_GUIDE.md); the live host was originally compiled
natively on Amazon Linux 2023 (x86_64) with:

- Toolchain: Go 1.26.4 at `/usr/local/go`, `ocb` (collector builder) v0.150.0.
- Build workspace `/tmp/otelbuild`: `builder.yaml` manifest, `src/` (the patched
  receiver), `_build/` output.
- Manifest pins core/contrib to **v0.150.0 / v1.56.0** (matching the receiver's
  `go.mod`) and uses a `replaces:` directive pointing `yanggrpcreceiver` at the
  patched source. Components built in: `hostmetrics`, `yang_grpc`,
  `batchprocessor`, `splunkhecexporter` only.
- Output binary installed at `/usr/local/bin/otelcol-yangfix` (~30 MB, `root:root` 0755).

### How it is wired into systemd (reversible)

The stock unit runs `/usr/bin/otelcol $OTELCOL_OPTIONS` and the Splunk distro
auto-reads `SPLUNK_CONFIG`; a vanilla collector does not, so a **drop-in override**
supplies the config explicitly:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/splunk-otel-collector.service.d/override.conf
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/otelcol-yangfix --config=${SPLUNK_CONFIG}
```

Everything else (User `splunk-otel-collector`, `EnvironmentFile`) is unchanged.
This repo ships the sample as
[`systemd/override.conf.example`](systemd/override.conf.example); install it as
`override.conf`, then apply with
`sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart splunk-otel-collector.service`.

### Backups (on host) — `/opt/otel-backup/2026-06-23/`

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `otelcol.v0.154.2.bak` | original 455 MB rpm Splunk-distro binary (sha256-verified) |
| `agent_config.yaml.bak` | live config at deploy time |
| `splunk-otel-collector.service.bak` | original unit file |
| `splunk-otel-collector.conf.bak` | original env file |

### Rollback to the stock Splunk distro

```bash
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/splunk-otel-collector.service.d/override.conf
sudo rmdir /etc/systemd/system/splunk-otel-collector.service.d 2>/dev/null
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart splunk-otel-collector.service
# the untouched /usr/bin/otelcol (rpm) runs again — numeric keys revert to dropped.
```

> **Restart gotcha:** the old process does **not** drain its gRPC dial-out
> streams on `SIGTERM`. systemd waits out `TimeoutStopSec` (~90 s), logs
> `Failed with result 'timeout'`, force-kills it, then the new process starts
> cleanly. Expect a **~90 s telemetry gap** on every restart — verify the new
> process logged `Everything is ready` afterwards.

### Verify after any restart

```bash
sudo journalctl -u splunk-otel-collector --since '2 min ago' --no-pager | grep 'Everything is ready'
ss -tnp | grep ':57444' | wc -l    # expect 6 (all fabric devices reconnected)
curl -s localhost:8888/metrics | grep otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points   # expect 0 / absent
```

Confirm numeric keys are present in Splunk (admin account required — the legacy
`cisco` user has no index ACL):

```bash
curl -sk -u '***REMOVED***:<password>' \
  'https://localhost:8089/servicesNS/nobody/campus_evpn_assurance/search/jobs/export' \
  --data-urlencode 'search=| mcatalog values(_dims) AS d WHERE index=evpn_assurance "cisco.encoding_path"="Cisco-IOS-XE-nve-oper:nve-oper-data/nve-oper/nve-peer-oper/peer-vni-group" earliest=-3m latest=now | nomv d' \
  --data-urlencode 'output_mode=csv'
```

Expected dims now **include** `vni` and `evni` (in addition to
`cisco.node_id node_id peer-addr value`), confirming the fix is live.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `is-active` stuck `deactivating (stop-sigterm)` after restart | gRPC dial-out streams not draining on SIGTERM | Wait ~90 s for systemd `TimeoutStopSec` to force-kill; the new process then starts. Don't keep restarting. |
| No data in `evpn_assurance` after restart | Devices not yet reconnected, or HEC (`:8088`) was down | Check `ss -tnp | grep 57444` for 6 ESTAB streams; check `ss -tlnp | grep 8088`; check `otelcol_exporter_send_failed_metric_points` at `http://localhost:8888/metrics`. |
| `| mstats count WHERE index=evpn_assurance` returns 0 | Bare `count` with no `metric_name` filter is a known quirk on this metric index | Use a real metric, e.g. `mstats latest("cisco.cp-vnis.") BY "cisco.node_id"`. |
| Panels grouped `BY "vni-type"`/`"nve-vni-vrf"`/`"last-update"`/`"ni-name"` return empty | Those string content leaves are no longer dimensions under the patched receiver — they are now `cisco.<leaf>_info` metrics with the string in the generic `value` attribute | Rewrite to group `BY "<numeric-key>"` (e.g. `"vni-id"`, `"vni"`) and join the `_info` metric on that key. The app v1.5.0/build 85 already does this. |
| `vni`/`evni` missing on `peer-vni-group` | Running the **stock** `/usr/bin/otelcol` (rollback state) — it drops numeric list keys | Confirm `otelcol-yangfix` is active (`systemctl show -p ExecStart splunk-otel-collector`); if rolled back, re-apply the drop-in override (see [Custom collector build & rollback](#custom-collector-build--rollback)). |
